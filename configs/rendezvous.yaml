rendezvous:
  # Minimum wait time in seconds the rendezvous server will accept for TO0 rendezvous entries.
  # If an owner server requests a wait time lower than this value during TO0,
  # the request will be rejected.
  # This prevents owner servers from setting very short wait times that could
  # cause devices to miss their rendezvous window.
  # Default: 0 (no minimum, all requests accepted)
  ##to0_min_wait: 0

  # Maximum wait time in seconds the rendezvous server will accept for TO0 rendezvous entries.
  # If an owner server requests a wait time higher than this value during TO0,
  # the request will be accepted but the wait time will be capped at this maximum.
  # This prevents owner servers from registering rendezvous blobs for excessively long periods.
  # Default: 86400 (24 hours)
